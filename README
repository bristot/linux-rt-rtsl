Linux PREEMPT-RT kernel
=======================

This is the development tree of the Preempt-RT patchset. For more information
about Preempt-RT please visit
	https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/start

This tree usually has only one set of branches that are updated (the current
one) and the old development branches are left stale. Those branches are
maintained in the "stable RT" tree which is located at
	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/

A list of maintained and no longer maintained kernel tree is available in RT wiki:
